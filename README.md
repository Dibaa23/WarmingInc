# Hawaii VR Island Management Sim

## Overview
This virtual reality application is an interactive simulation where the player assumes the role of an overarching politician managing the island of Hawaii. Players interact with various policies and decisions that affect the island's people, economy, and ecosystem, represented through dynamic, responsive bars within the game's interface.

## Current State
- **Basic Interactions:** Configured basic interaction and VR movement for an immersive user experience.
- **User Interface:** Implemented UI elements to reflect the "People", "Economy", and "Ecosystem" bars which dynamically change based on the player's decisions.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Database Integration:**
    - Upload a comprehensive database containing various locations in Hawaii.
    - Categorize the information into policies affecting "People", "Ecosystem", and "Economy", including those that overlap categories.

2. **Model and Markers:**
    - Integrate a 3D model of the Hawaiian Islands into the simulation.
    - Place interactive markers on the model that, when pointed at, will pop up with relevant policies for that location.

3. **Policy Interaction:**
    - Implement a system for approving or rejecting policies through a VR interface.
    - Design the mechanics by which these decisions affect the corresponding stats bars in real-time.

## Long-term Goals
- Develop a robust system that simulates the consequences of policy decisions on the island's well-being.
- Implement real-time feedback and visual effects that illustrate the impact of player decisions on Hawaii's environment and its inhabitants.
- Create an engaging narrative and educational content that guides players through the complexities of managing an island ecosystem.
